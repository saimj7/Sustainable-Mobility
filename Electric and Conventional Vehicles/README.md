# Electric & Conventional Vehicles

> Model-Based Development using qss in Simulink

> Electric and Conventional vehicle powertrains

> Sustainable Mobility | Chalmers

---

***For now, we only concentrate on installing the QSS library, required to size and analyze the Conventional (ICU), Electric vehicle powertrains!***

> Dig deeper into the repositories to simulate different powertrains

> Understand fuel consumption and energy efficiency

[![The QSS Library for Simulink:](https://i.imgur.com/hLJtirD.jpeg)]()

- First Install MATLAB and Simulink
- Download the qss library from the repo

---

## To run qss:

- Open MATLAB and set the path for all folders within the downloaded qss library
- Type qss_tb_library in the command window

```javascript
qss_tb_library
```

- That should open qss in Simulink!
